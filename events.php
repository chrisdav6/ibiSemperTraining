                <p>Bark Brew & Tattoo is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that brings people together through creative fundraising events in Upstate New York. Our mission is to break down the harmful stereotypes surrounding often misunderstood breeds—including Pit Bulls, Staffordshire Terriers, American Bulldogs, Rottweilers, Mastiffs, and more—by promoting education, advocacy, and responsible ownership. Each event combines fun, community, and purpose, offering a welcoming space where guests can enjoy themselves while educating and celebrating about the importance of fair treatment for all animals. We collaborate with ethical rescue groups in our area to feature adoption opportunities. Proceeds from our events directly support these carefully selected beneficiaries that provide care, protection, and second chances for these beloved breeds.</p>

                <p>Tribute by Jenelle: <a class="link text-dark" href="https://www.facebook.com/dylan.eder.9" target="_blank">Dylan Eder</a> passed on June 1st 2019. A day he had plans for, a day the weather was ideal for being outside, on the bike. As these years wage on without him, It feels few and far between that people talk about him, or remember him, making the weight of the loss heavier and heavier. I never want to stop talking about him, to remember him, because he is worth remembering.
                </p>

                <p>The goal of this memorial ride is to spend the day doing something Dylan would love. Doing it to remember him and honor him and to eat a lot of BBQ. If You are a rider please join us and bring your friends! whether you had the chance to meet Dylan or not, chances are you’ve heard a story about him or have felt the impact of his life in some way.</p>

                <p>We again have chosen to donate this year’s contributions to the Ibi Semper Training organization. Ibi Semper brings our Veteran brothers and sisters together and pairs them with service dogs, to train, to love, and to protect as they navigate living in a world with PTSD and other mental health needs post military service. Dylan was a proud Marine and an avid animal lover, making this local charity one we think he would be proud to support. <a class="link text-dark" href="https://gofund.me/145e8d04" target="_blank">Please consider donating!</a>
                </p>
